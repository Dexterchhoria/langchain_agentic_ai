Generation (RAG) App: Part 2On this pageBuild a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 2\\nIn many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of \"memory\" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.\\nThis is a the second part of a multi-part tutorial:\\n\\nPart 1 introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\\nPart 2 (this guide) extends the implementation to accommodate conversation-style interactions and multi-step retrieval processes.\\n\\nHere we focus on adding logic for incorporating historical messages. This involves the management of a chat history.\\nWe will cover two approaches:\\n\\nChains, in which we execute at most one retrieval step;\\nAgents, in which we give an LLM discretion to execute multiple retrieval steps.\\n\\nnoteThe methods presented here leverage tool-calling capabilities in modern chat models. See this page for a table of models supporting tool calling features.\\nFor the external knowledge source, we will use the same LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng from the Part 1 of the RAG tutorial.\\nSetup\\u200b\\nComponents\\u200b\\nWe will need to select three components from LangChain\\'s suite of integrations.\\n\\nSelect chat model:Groq‚ñæGroqOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogleAWSCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIDatabrickspip install -qU langchain-groqimport getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"GROQ_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for Groq: \")from langchain_groq import ChatGroqllm = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")\\n\\nSelect embeddings model:OpenAI‚ñæOpenAIAzureGoogleAWSHuggingFaceOllamaCohereMistralAINomicNVIDIAVoyage AIFakepip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for OpenAI: \")from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-3-large\")\\n\\nSelect vector store:In-memory‚ñæIn-memoryAstraDBChromaFAISSMilvusMongoDBPGVectorPineconeQdrantpip install -qU langchain-corefrom langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStorevector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(embeddings)\\nDependencies\\u200b\\nIn addition, we\\'ll use the following packages:\\n%%capture --no-stderr%pip install --upgrade --quiet langgraph langchain-community beautifulsoup4\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nNote that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"if not os.environ.get(\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"):    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\nChains\\u200b\\nLet\\'s first revisit the vector store we built in Part 1, which indexes an LLM Powered Autonomous Agents blog post by Lilian Weng.\\nimport bs4from langchain import hubfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain_core.documents import Documentfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitterfrom typing_extensions import List, TypedDict# Load and chunk contents of the blogloader = WebBaseLoader(    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),    bs_kwargs=dict(        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(            class_=(\"post-content\", \"post-title\", \"post-header\")        )    ),)docs = loader.load()text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)API Reference:hub | WebBaseLoader | Document | RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n# Index chunks_ = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)\\nIn the Part 1 of the RAG tutorial, we represented the user input, retrieved context, and generated answer as separate keys in the state. Conversational experiences can be naturally represented using a sequence of messages. In addition to messages from the user and assistant, retrieved documents and other artifacts can be incorporated into a message sequence via tool messages. This motivates us to represent the state of our RAG application using a sequence of messages. Specifically, we will have\\n\\nUser input as a HumanMessage;\\nVector store query as an AIMessage with tool calls;\\nRetrieved documents as a ToolMessage;\\nFinal response as a AIMessage.\\n\\nThis model for state is so versatile that LangGraph offers a built-in version for convenience:\\nfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraphgraph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)API Reference:StateGraph\\nLeveraging tool-calling to interact with a retrieval step has another benefit, which is that the query for the retrieval is generated by our model. This is especially important in a conversational setting, where user queries may require contextualization based on the chat history. For instance, consider the following exchange:\\n\\nHuman: \"What is Task Decomposition?\"\\nAI: \"Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable for an agent or model.\"\\nHuman: \"What are common ways of doing it?\"\\n\\nIn this scenario, a model could generate a query such as \"common approaches to task decomposition\". Tool-calling facilitates this naturally. As in the query analysis section of the RAG tutorial, this allows a model to rewrite user queries into more effective search queries. It also provides support for direct responses that do not involve a retrieval step (e.g., in response to a generic greeting from the user).\\nLet\\'s turn our retrieval step into a tool:\\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")def retrieve(query: str):    \"\"\"Retrieve information related to a query.\"\"\"    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)    serialized = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(        (f\"Source: {doc.metadata}\\\\n\" f\"Content: {doc.page_content}\")        for doc in retrieved_docs    )    return serialized, retrieved_docsAPI Reference:tool\\nSee this guide for more detail on creating tools.\\nOur graph will consist of three nodes:\\n\\nA node that fields the user input, either generating a query for the retriever or responding directly;\\nA node for the retriever tool that executes the retrieval step;\\nA node that generates the final response using the retrieved context.\\n\\nWe build them below. Note that we leverage another pre-built LangGraph component, ToolNode, that executes the tool and adds the result as a ToolMessage to the state.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import SystemMessagefrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode# Step 1: Generate an AIMessage that may include a tool-call to be sent.def query_or_respond(state: MessagesState):    \"\"\"Generate tool call for retrieval or respond.\"\"\"    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([retrieve])    response = llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])    # MessagesState appends messages to state instead of overwriting    return {\"messages\": [response]}# Step 2: Execute the retrieval.tools = ToolNode([retrieve])# Step 3: Generate a response using the retrieved content.def generate(state: MessagesState):    \"\"\"Generate answer.\"\"\"    # Get generated ToolMessages    recent_tool_messages = []    for message in reversed(state[\"messages\"]):        if message.type == \"tool\":            recent_tool_messages.append(message)        else:            break    tool_messages = recent_tool_messages[::-1]    # Format into prompt    docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.content for doc in tool_messages)    system_message_content = (        \"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \"        \"Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer \"        \"the question. If you don\\'t know the answer, say that you \"        \"don\\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the \"        \"answer concise.\"        \"\\\\n\\\\n\"        f\"{docs_content}\"    )    conversation_messages = [        message        for message in state[\"messages\"]        if message.type in (\"human\", \"system\")        or (message.type == \"ai\" and not message.tool_calls)    ]    prompt = [SystemMessage(system_message_content)] + conversation_messages    # Run    response = llm.invoke(prompt)    return {\"messages\": [response]}API Reference:SystemMessage | ToolNode\\nFinally, we compile our application into a single graph object. In this case, we are just connecting the steps into a sequence. We also allow the first query_or_respond step to \"short-circuit\" and respond directly to the user if it does not generate a tool call. This allows our application to support conversational experiences-- e.g., responding to generic greetings that may not require a retrieval step\\nfrom langgraph.graph import ENDfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_conditiongraph_builder.add_node(query_or_respond)graph_builder.add_node(tools)graph_builder.add_node(generate)graph_builder.set_entry_point(\"query_or_respond\")graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(    \"query_or_respond\",    tools_condition,    {END: END, \"tools\": \"tools\"},)graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"generate\")graph_builder.add_edge(\"generate\", END)graph = graph_builder.compile()API Reference:ToolNode | tools_condition\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, displaydisplay(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\nLet\\'s test our application.\\nNote that it responds appropriately to messages that do not require an additional retrieval step:\\ninput_message = \"Hello\"for step in graph.stream(    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": input_message}]},    stream_mode=\"values\",):    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n================================\\x1b[1m Human Message \\x1b[0m=================================Hello==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Hello!

It often involves techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT), which encourages models to think step by step, enhancing performance on complex tasks. This approach allows for a clearer understanding of the task and aids in structuring the problem-solving process.\\nCheck out the LangSmith trace here.\\nStateful management of chat history\\u200b\\nnoteThis section of the tutorial previously used the RunnableWithMessageHistory abstraction. You can access that version of the documentation in the v0.2 docs.As of the v0.3 release of LangChain, we recommend that LangChain users take advantage of LangGraph persistence to incorporate memory into new LangChain applications.If your code is already relying on RunnableWithMessageHistory or BaseChatMessageHistory, you do not need to make any changes. We do not plan on deprecating this functionality in the near future as it works for simple chat applications and any code that uses RunnableWithMessageHistory will continue to work as expected.Please see How to migrate to LangGraph Memory for more details.\\nIn production, the Q&A application will usually persist the chat history into a database, and be able to read and update it appropriately.\\nLangGraph implements a built-in persistence layer, making it ideal for chat applications that support multiple conversational turns.\\nTo manage multiple conversational turns and threads, all we have to do is specify a checkpointer when compiling our application. Because the nodes in our graph are appending messages to the state, we will retain a consistent chat history across invocations.\\nLangGraph comes with a simple in-memory checkpointer, which we use below. See its documentation for more detail, including how to use different persistence backends (e.g., SQLite or Postgres).\\nFor a detailed walkthrough of how to manage message history, head to the How to add message history (memory) guide.\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySavermemory = MemorySaver()graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)# Specify an ID for the threadconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"abc123\"}}API Reference:MemorySaver\\nWe can now invoke similar to before:\\ninput_message = \"What is Task Decomposition?\"for step in graph.stream(    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": input_message}]},    stream_mode=\"values\",    config=config,):    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n================================\\x1b[1m Human Message \\x1b[0m=================================What is Task Decomposition?==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Tool Calls:  retrieve (call_JZb6GLD812bW2mQsJ5EJQDnN) Call ID: call_JZb6GLD812bW2mQsJ5EJQDnN  Args:    query: Task Decomposition=================================\\x1b[1m Tool Message \\x1b[0m=================================Name: retrieveSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}Content: Fig. 1.

Using LangGraph\\'s pre-built ReAct agent constructor, we can do this in one line.\\ntipCheck out LangGraph\\'s Agentic RAG tutorial for more advanced formulations.\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agentagent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, [retrieve], checkpointer=memory)API Reference:create_react_agent\\nLet\\'s inspect the graph:\\ndisplay(Image(agent_executor.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n\\nThe key difference from our earlier implementation is that instead of a final generation step that ends the run, here the tool invocation loops back to the original LLM call. The model can then either answer the question using the retrieved context, or generate another tool call to obtain more information.\\nLet\\'s test this out. We construct a question that would typically require an iterative sequence of retrieval steps to answer:\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"def234\"}}input_message = (    \"What is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\\\n\\\\n\"    \"Once you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\")for event in agent_executor.stream(    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": input_message}]},    stream_mode=\"values\",    config=config,):    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n================================\\x1b[1m Human Message \\x1b[0m=================================What is the standard method for Task Decomposition?Once you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================Tool Calls:  retrieve (call_Y3YaIzL71B83Cjqa8d2G0O8N) Call ID: call_Y3YaIzL71B83Cjqa8d2G0O8N  Args:    query: standard method for Task Decomposition=================================\\x1b[1m Tool Message \\x1b[0m=================================Name: retrieveSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}Content: Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.

CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model‚Äôs thinking process.==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================The standard method for task decomposition involves using techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), where a model is instructed to \"think step by step\" to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components. This approach enhances model performance by allowing for more thorough reasoning and planning. Task decomposition can be accomplished through various means, including:1. Simple prompting (e.g., asking for steps to achieve a goal).2. Task-specific instructions (e.g., asking for a story outline).3. Human inputs to guide the decomposition process.### Common Extensions of Task Decomposition Methods:1. **Tree of Thoughts**: This extension builds on CoT by not only decomposing the problem into thought steps but also generating multiple thoughts at each step, creating a tree structure. The search process can employ breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), with each state evaluated by a classifier or through majority voting.These extensions aim to enhance reasoning capabilities and improve the effectiveness of task decomposition in various contexts.\\nNote that the agent:\\n\\nGenerates a query to search for a standard method for task decomposition;\\nReceiving the answer, generates a second query to search for common extensions of it;\\nHaving received all necessary context, answers the question.\\n\\nWe can see the full sequence of steps, along with latency and other metadata, in the LangSmith trace.\\nNext steps\\u200b\\nWe\\'ve covered the steps to build a basic conversational Q&A application:\\n\\nWe used chains to build a predictable application that generates at most one query per user input;\\nWe used agents to build an application that can iterate on a sequence of queries.\\n\\nTo explore different types of retrievers and retrieval strategies, visit the retrievers section of the how-to guides.\\nFor a detailed walkthrough of LangChain\\'s conversation memory abstractions, visit the How to add message history (memory) guide.\\nTo learn more about agents, check out the conceptual guide and LangGraph agent architectures page.Edit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousBuild a ChatbotNextBuild an Extraction ChainSetupComponentsDependenciesLangSmithChainsStateful management of chat historyAgentsNext stepsCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright ¬© 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"
